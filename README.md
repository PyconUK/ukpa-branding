# UK Python Association Logos and Branding

## Legal
"Python" is a registered trademark of the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"). The Python logos (in several variants) are trademarks of the PSF as well, and are used with permission.

## Usage
These logos must only be used by the UK Python Association ("UKPA"), or with express written permission of the UKPA.

The "No TM" logos are only to be used on social media platforms where a round avatar is required.

Similarly, SVGs should always be used before PNGs, and should be converted to a more suitable format if possible.
